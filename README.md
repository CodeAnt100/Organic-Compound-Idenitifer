## Organic Compound Identifier
### Overview
This Python program is able to generate the IUPAC name for certain groups of organic compounds (Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes, Carboxylic Acids, Nitriles, Aldehydes, Ketones, Alcohols, Amines, those with multiple functional groups, and those with different branched compounds) when given a typed structural formula for it, and the program's functionality is integrated into a basic website format.

### Motivation
In my sixth form chemistry lessons, when learning about the complicated nature of IUPAC naming for organic compounds (like with order of precedence of functional groups and branch-number minimisation), I was curious to see if these set of rules could be translated to an automatic process that could generate the name for you. From what I could find on the internet at the time, there were only database-oriented schemes to find desired compounds, and nothing which seemed inherently generative.

While the project initially started as an implementation of my idea for my very first hackathon, I got nowhere near to finishing it within the time limit. However, I really wanted to be able to get a fully working version of it (and my original code was horrendously messy), so I started from scratch to get a terminal-based input version of it working.

I wanted to then make this tool available to my school's chemistry department, and so I followed along with a MOOC to create a basic web application in Django.
