        <h2> Welcome to the organic identification program! </h2> Made by Anant Gupta <br><br><br>
        This program allows you to input a structural formula for an organic compound and outputs its IUPAC name. <br>
        The types of functional groups and organic compounds this program can identify include:
        <ul>
            <li>Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkynes (including compounds with multiple double and triple bonds)</li>
            <li>Carboxylic Acids (COOH), Nitriles (CN), Aldehydes (CHO), Ketones (COC), Alcohols (OH) and Amines (NH2)</li>
            <li>Compounds with multiple functional groups in different positions and with correct precedence naming</li>
            <li>Branched compounds containing Fluorine (F), Iodine (I), Bromine (Br), Chlorine (Cl) and Alkyls (CH3, C2H5, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        N.B. The program does not accept condensed structural formulae (e.g. CH3(CH2)5CH3)
